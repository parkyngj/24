# Local usage notes (for my own reference)

* Make sure you have npm
* Run `npm install` to get dependencies
* Run `mongod --dbpath ROOT/data/db --port 27017`
* Run `npm start` to seed hand data and start up server
* To look inside mongod server: Run `mongo`, then `use hands` inside of mongo shell to access db
